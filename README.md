Hi Ashley,    
   
I just finished imported all the stock images you need for the website.  

In the repo, youâ€™ll find a whole page effect jpg file as well as an annotated jpg file   together with the all the css properties you need for the website.     

Have fun working on the site and I have already the fonts you will need in the css file.
